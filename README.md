# VŠB-TUO Spin-off Metrics Framework

A comprehensive metrics and KPI framework for tracking and improving the creation of university spin-off companies at VŠB – Technical University of Ostrava (Czech Republic).

## Overview

This project presents a single-page HTML dashboard that helps university leadership, technology transfer offices, and researchers systematically measure and improve the university's spin-off ecosystem. The strategic goal is to position VŠB-TUO as the leading Czech university in founding successful spin-off companies by 2030.

**Target outcomes:**
- 8–12 new spin-offs with validated products on the market
- At least 3 spin-offs achieving positive cash flow

## What's Inside

The framework organizes 50+ metrics across six key categories using a **Lead/Lag × Input/Output/Outcome/Impact** matrix:

| Category | Focus |
|---|---|
| **Research & IP Pipeline** | R&D capacity, patents, licensing |
| **Infrastructure & Support Ecosystem** | CTT/CPI budgets, mentors, VC partnerships, incubators |
| **Culture & Entrepreneurial Mindset** | Evaluation incentives, courses, IP policies |
| **Spin-off Pipeline & Funnel** | Conversion from concept to founded company |
| **Spin-off Success & Impact** | Funding, customers, employment, survival rates |
| **Talent & Interdisciplinary Teams** | Cross-faculty collaboration, business co-founders |

### Metric Classification

- **Lead indicators** (predictive): Input and Output metrics — identify problems early
- **Lag indicators** (confirmatory): Outcome and Impact metrics — validate whether strategies worked
- **Priority levels**: High (red), Medium (orange), Lower (green)
